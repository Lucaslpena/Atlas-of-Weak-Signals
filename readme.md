# Atlas of Weak Signals (AoWS)
Our current world is a convulsed place, subjected to immense systemic crises that generate uncertainties about the survival of the status quo in multiple spheres. Only through forecasting can we develop preparedness for addressing these existential threats.

Every future scenario is built by detecting “weak signals” that set trends and point to certain directions. Therefore, based on the analysis of the main-change factors we can detect these signals in the present.

This visualization is just that. Built on a corpus of academic research, data scraping, and keyword mapping with machine learning, we identified 25 different weak signals of the future and various key-terms which are associated with each weak signal. We aspire to next iterations on this body of information and its persistence as a forecasting tool not only for future changemakers but all who want to be involved.
